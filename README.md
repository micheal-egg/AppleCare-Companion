# AppleCare-Companion-

**AppleCare Companion** is a full-stack concept project inspired by Apple's customer support ecosystem.  
It connects a SwiftUI iOS app to a custom Python Flask REST API that tracks registered Apple devices, calculates AppleCare warranty coverage, and provides live status checks — just like an internal AppleCare support tool.

- 📱 **Frontend:** SwiftUI iOS App (MVVM, async/await, Codable)
- 🖥️ **Backend:** Python Flask REST API (JSON endpoints, warranty logic)
- ☁️ **Architecture:** RESTful, local-first, expandable for AWS hosting
